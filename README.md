3. Run "nano get.py"
4. Edit the variables "key" and "ids"
5. Run "chmod +x start.bash"

Thank you to this blog post: https://defaultnamehere.tumblr.com/post/139351766005/graphing-when-your-facebook-friends-are-awake for giving me the idea. This does not use the code from this project, but when reading this blog post I had the idea of doing the same thing for steam.
